What accounts for the low-lying, flat surface of Mars’s north? 

On Earth’s surface, higher- and lower-lying areas have different types of crust: one, thin and dense, is pulled toward Earth’s center more strongly by gravity, and the planet’s water naturally comes to sit over it, creating oceans.
句子收藏:
one, thin and dense, is pulled toward Earth’s center more strongly by gravity

The processes that generate this oceanic crust drive plate tectonics.


Is Mars’s north similarly characterized by a sort of crust different from other areas of the planet?

Some researchers do see signs of tectonic activity surrounding the northern basin that suggest that it was created through the formation of new crust, like ocean basins on Earth.
单词: 
basin 盆地 反应慢了 

However, McGill points to Northern bedrock structures that predate the features said to mark the start of the tectonic process.
句子读不懂 有疑问!!! 但是知道肯定是是否定

McGill instead believes that through some novel mechanism the ancient surface sank to its current depth as a single unit. 
This would explain why features around the basin’s edge, which would have formed as the surface dropped, seem to be younger than structures at its floor.

The third possibility is that the northern lowlands result from impacts. 
Some researchers suggest they formed as a series of big overlapping impact craters. 
Others arguing that the odds against such a pattern of impacts are large, postulate a single event-the impact of an object bigger than any asteroid the solar system now contains.


the odds against such a pattern of impacts are large
反对这种(多重撞击)类型的撞击的可能 是很大的
(前面说的那种撞击模式 可能性很低)
是这个意思吗???

单词:
postulate 假设
