Passage 45
原来橡树 没有了 
teak 寻找?

Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. It can be inferred from the passage that an advantage of teak over mahogany is that teak is:
A. more compatible with the materials in existing ships.
对的 修船
 B. less susceptible to rot and pests
对 resistance 
C. available in greater quantities in inland jungles
对
2. In the context in which it appears, ‘turned to” most nearly means
A. rotated  转 
B. resorted to  记过 借助于???
C. deflected from  反射出???
D. reverted to  恢复到
E. revolved around 不知道

选A


C选项还是不很清楚

C 不选  因为题目中是和MA比较 MA 也很多  
所以 多不是优势


Moreover, it was one of two important tropical hardwoods (with Central American mahogany) that dried light enough to float downriver--the only way to transport timber in quantity from the inland jungles where it grew.

单词: 
resorted to 借助于 寻求 
reverted to  回归
deflect from  从...偏斜   意思说反了
deflect 转向 弯曲
revolve around 围着什么转

AE 相同排除  B才能更好的表达 寻找的那层意思  
主要不是转变
