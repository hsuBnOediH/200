Passage 2
事实: M MH 作者写的不对, H 描述讲故事场景 中有自己
真事实: 有另外一个真的version 这个没有讲故事的场景

原因解释: 可能因为出版社
JEW的观点: 认为 B文学是写作历史, 
H 在Jew之前

原因和JEW 不是很明白 关系

1. Select the sentence that suggests a possible reason why Hurston wrote the version of Mules and Men that was published in 1935.
选出版社那一句



without having to have a mediating voice to explain the stories to a non-Black audience. 
重点是对这句话的改写
2. The passage suggests that Hurston may have done which of the following in preparing her original version?
A. Discussed her mode of presentation with her publisher before writing the first draft, in order to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding.
不是为了避免误解
B. Shortened her presentation of the stories to the bare minimum in order to be able to present more folklore material.
好像不对 目的不确定
C. Put it aside for several decades in order to maximize its potential audience when it was published.
太肤浅
D. Reluctantly agreed to reshape it in order to take out various elements with which her publisher had been dissatisfied.
不是再秒写origgnal version
E. Chose not to include editorial commentary, in order to present the stories on their own terms.

纠结BE 
选E


都正确但是第二题 逻辑上还需要理一理
明白了 不用了
但是感觉直接什么黑人作家  前面没说作者是不是黑人 
好蠢 
作者名字 到底是什么 怎么好几个名字 
后面只谈论一个名字
