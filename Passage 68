Passage 68
事实: E 去A 的 比 A去E多
	解释:fact:   桥群在 habitat 
	变冷 海面low 桥有了 可以去
	变热 high 几率小  只有 log 可

1.
B 方向
C 冰河期没提到 温带生物
D 没说到
E more ? 比较不在

选A

2. 
A 反了
B 没看懂
C wide diversity?
D 可能
E 都热 A像B 和 B像A 有区别的吧??????

选D

3. 
A 不是温度的
B 有就不lack
C 不对
D 没说
E 选E


Historically, more cold-adapted antelope species originating in Eurasia have migrated into Africa, where the climate is generally warmer, than have warm-adapted African species into Eurasia. 
这个长难句看了好几遍才看懂  主要没看出了这个比较  可以收藏下
历史上 来自从E迁移到普遍更温暖的非洲的 适应冷的羚羊 要比 适应热的费总生物到E  多

单词:
antelope 羚羊


A likely explanation for this involves the fact that intercontinental migrations require both a land bridge connecting the two continents and the suitable habitat both on and across that land bridge. 
and 大并列 反映了一会 阅读慢 就来自这些地方 

During periods of climatic cooling, such as the various ice ages, the land bridge is open for a long time (because sea level remains low) and is usable by cold-adapt species because cool habitats then extend across it.

Thus during cooling most migrants would be expected to travel toward Africa, which is near the equator, since this is the direction dictated by habitat changes on a cooling Earth.
尽管在冷的环境下 大多是的迁移 被期望是 去到 非洲,非洲接近赤道, 因为 这个方向是被变冷的 地球上的 栖息地变化 指明的
单词:
thus 因此
equator 赤道 
dictated by 由()影响

In contrast, when the Earth is warm, the land bridge is reduced or gone because sea level is relatively high then. Only during the short lag between onset of global temperature change and sea level response can warm-adapted species migrate from the equator toward higher latitudes.
