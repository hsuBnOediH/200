Passage 52
1. Which of the following can be inferred about the ‘university lecture hall’ mentioned in the passage?
A. It was not originally designed to be used for lecture.
B. It was more suitable for listening to music than for listening to the spoken word.
C. Its walls had surfaces made of material with very poor sound-absorbing properties.
D. Its poor acoustics resulted from its being designed to accommodate a large audience.
E. It was constructed at a time when sound-absorbing building materials were not readily available.
C

2. The passage suggests that Sabine’s work made which of the following possible for the first time?
A. to make a room soundproof
B. to build an auditorium out of sound-absorbing materials
C. to construct an enclosed space in which sound would not echo
D. to design a building to meet predetermined specifications with regard to echo duration
E. to render any large room usable for public lectures and performances

to design a building to meet predetermined specifications with regard to echo duration
在考虑到回声持续时间的情况下 设计一个可以meet 要求的建筑

The physicist Wallace Sabine pioneered the scientific study of architectural acoustics when he was asked in 1895 to fix a university lecture hall in which the echo of a speaker’s words rendered them unintelligible.
unintelligible 莫名其妙的
He found that the length of time it takes a sound’s echo to decay is determined by the absorption of the sound’s original energy by surrounding material. 
By hanging panels of sound-absorbing felt on the walls, Sabine reduced the echo enough to make the hall usable.
And the data he compiled yielded a mathematical formula for the relationship between a room’s echo duration, its quantity and quality of sound-absorbing materials, and its spatial volume.
