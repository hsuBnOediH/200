Passage 54


Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply
1. Life on Europa in the form suggested in the passage would be dependent on
A. the protection Europa’s icy crust gives against the harmful components of sunlight
B. the existence of water on Europa
C. the motion of Europa around Jupiter
BC


2. The highlighted sentence “take Jupiter’s moon Europa” serves to introduce
A. an instance that allows a hypothesis to be tested
B. speculation grounded in empirical discovery
C. a deduction from a newly advanced hypothesis
D. a large-scale effect of an apparently insignificant contingency
E. the derivation of a contradiction to refute a claim
C


The discovery of subsurface life on Earth, surviving independently from surface life, refuted the belief that biological processes require not only liquid water but sunlight as well, thus greatly enhancing the possibility of life beyond Earth. 
Take Jupiter’s moon Europa.
这里省略了 as a example 
Space probes show a body covered with a thick layer of ice.
单词!!! probes 检测器 给阅读造成了困扰! 

As Europa orbits its planet, however, it flexes due to the gravitational tug-of-war between it,its sister moons, and Jupiter.
单词 flex 弯曲
tug-of-war 拔河!!!

Through friction, this flexing produces heat in the moon’s interior capable of melting ice.
Indeed,observations suggest liquid water exists beneath Europa’s icy crust. Photosynthetic life isimpossible there because sunlight is completely absent, but life such as the microbes that
flourish deep within earth may still be possible.



第二做错 主要是因为BC选项的问题 
C选的时候疑惑了一下 这个hypo 

排除B的原因是speculation 理解成了壮观的 
spectacular!!! 壮观的     词根  spectacle 大场面
speculation!!! 猜测 推测   词根 speculate 推测
