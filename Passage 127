Passage 127
1 下面哪一个可以让最近的seism 证据变得无效
E

2. 大多因为下列的什么
B


Most seismologists assume that following a major earthquake and its aftershocks, the fault (a break in Earth’s crust where pressure can trigger an earthquake) will remain quiet until stresses have time to rebuild, typically over hundreds or thousands of years.
大多数人信时间长
Recent evidence of subtle interactions between earthquakes may overturn this assumption, however. 
最近发现不对
According to the stress-triggering hypothesis, faults are unexpectedly responsive to subtle stresses they acquire as neighboring faults shift. 
stress-triggering hypothesis 这个是大都数人信的 
还是turnover之后的???
unexpectedly responsive to

Rather than simply dissipating, stress relieved during an earthquake travels along the fault, concentrating in sites nearby; even the smallest additional stresses may then trigger another quake along the fault or on a nearby fault.

Although scientists have long viewed such subtle interactions as nonexistent, the hypothesis has explained the location and frequency of earthquakes following several destructive quakes in California, Japan, and Turkey.


第2题做错 没分清楚 文章后面讨论的道理是新的还是旧的  
我看到
unexpectedly responsive to subtle stresses 
我认为他和前面相反的 long
题目让选旧的
我排除AC 选的B 想不明白
