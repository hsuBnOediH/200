Schaller suggested that the mane protects the area of
the body “towards which most social contact is directed” by absorbing blows and bites.

 Darker
mane hairs are thicker than lighter hairs, so darker manes may provide better protection.
猜测
These ideas suggest that males with longer and darker manes will be wounded less frequently and/or with less severity on 
the area covered by the mane, but direct tests of this prediction are difficult. Individual males are seldom seen 
daily, and the mane itself obscures many wounds beneath it
rom view. Furthermore, even in the best studied population, 
serious fights between lions are rarely observed
