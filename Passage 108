In the early twentieth century, small magazines and the innovative graphics used on them created the face of the avant-guard.
前卫派的面孔
It was a look that signaled progressive ideas and unconventionality because it dispensed with the cardinal rule of graphic design: to take an idea and make it visually clear, concise, and instantly understood.

signaled 标志的
cardinal 主要的
concise 简明的
Instead, graphics produced by avant-guard artists exclusively for the avant-guard (as opposed to their advertising work) were usually difficult to decipher, ambiguous, or nonsensical. 
This overturning of convention, this assailing of standard graphic and typographic formats, was part of a search for intellectual freedom. 
assailing 攻击
The impulse toward liberation enabled avant-guardists to see with fresh eyes untried possibilities for arranging and relating words and images on paper.
