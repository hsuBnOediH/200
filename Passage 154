Passage 154
@@Late-eighteenth-century English cultural authorities seemingly concurred that women readers should favor history, seen as edifying, than fiction, which was regarded as frivolous and reductive.
authorities 当局
 seen as edifying 看作是有益处的
 frivolous and reductive 轻浮和简化的




@@ Readers of Marry Ann Hanway’s novel Andrew Stewart, or the Northern Wanderer, learning that its heroine delights in David Hume’s and Edward Gibbon’s histories, could conclude that she was more virtuous and intelligent than her sister, who disdains such reading. 

or the Northern Wanderer 又名 北方流放者
learning that its heroine delights in David Hume’s and Edward Gibbon’s histories 看不懂

Likewise, while the naïve, novel-addicted protagonist of Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey, Catherine Morland, finds history a chore, the sophisticated, sensible character Eleanor Tilney enjoys it more than she does the Gothic fiction Catherine prefers.
finds history a chore????
find that history is a chore?????
the Gothic fiction Catherine prefers 这是什么成分干嘛de?
这么多人名字 谁是谁 证明这么乱? 需要知道吗? 想说什么?





Yet in both cases, the praise of history is more double-edged than it might actually appear.
尽管在两种情况中 历史的赞美 比它实际更有两面性
看不下去了


Many readers have detected a protofeminist critique of history in Catherine’s protest that she dislikes reading books filled with men “and hardly any women at all.”
 Hanway,
meanwhile, brings a controversial political edge to her heroine’s reading, listing the era’s two
most famous religious skeptics among her preferred authors. While Hume’s history was
generally seen as being less objectionable than his philosophy, there were widespread doubts
about his moral soundness even as a historian by the time that Hanway was writing, and
Gibbon’s perceived tendency to celebrate classical paganism sparked controversy from the
first appearance of his history of Rome.
