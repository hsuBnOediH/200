	转折: R 吃 u , R 多 u少 
	u 吃 k, 保护ab 


1. 题目错了吗 是想问1980吗?
B

2. C


The waters east of Cape Hangklip were once the center of a lucrative wild-caught abalone fishery, but illegal fishing in the mid-1990s escalated to such levels that the recreational fishery was closed in 2003.
这个 such 是个什么? 直接理解成空前的???


单词:
waters 海域
fishery 渔场 
recreational 娱乐的 休闲的

When abalones did not rebound, commercial fishing was also banned.
这句话在文章中的作用理解不了 当数量没有反弹的时候
啥时候反弹了 从开头就说非法捕捞 减少啊?


Continue declines in abalone were attributed to poaching, but an invasion by rock lobsters during the early 1990s probably intensified the trend. 
单词: 
invasion 生物入侵 反应太慢了

Rock lobsters prey on sea urchins, and increased rock lobster densities coincided with significant decreases in urchins. 
In that area, urchins feed largely by trapping drift kelp, and in doing so provide juvenile abalone with both protective shelter and nourishment. 
Without urchins’ presence, juvenile abalones are less likely to survive to adulthood.
