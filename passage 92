1. The passage implies that most popular science writing
A. focuses on discrete results arrived at by scientific reasoning
B. spends more time describing scientific personalities than scientific processes
C. gives readers an incomplete view of the interrelatedness of scientific discovery



Most popularizations of science actually do more harm than good.
观点
Why? The single most important feature of scientific work is not this or that specific result. Instead, what science accomplishes--and what physics in particular accomplishes so beautifully--is the linking of diverse phenomena, the binding together of a myriad of predictions and explanations. 
解释: 非结论 而是link
What nearly all popularizations do is systematically undermine the progressive reasoning that links principles, conventions, experiments, and laws.
继续解释：　人多undermine 很多东西
Bad science writing splinters the most interestin1g feature of science, its long run of connected argumentation, into isolated metaphors that last just long enough to evoke a particular result: black holes are said to be huge funnels and quantum electron orbits are characterized as diffuse clouds.
