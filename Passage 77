Passage 77
B


Editors of major United States news magazines have been criticized for reducing the amount of space these magazines devote to international news.

According to these editors, however, readers are wholly to blame for the reductions.
单词: wholly 完全的

After all, the editors point out, sales of magazine issues that prominently feature international news stories have declined significantly, and declining sales reflect declining reader interest. 
主干没抓太好
sales refelct 
对吗???  这句 有疑问!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yet even if true, this evidence does not refute the contention that editors should bear some of the blame for the reductions, unless editors are merely passive instruments responding to reader interest. 
单词:
contention 争辩
bear 承担

And that is clearly an untenable view, since editors can often intensify reader interest in a news topic by giving it frequent coverage.

The first is evidence that has been used to support a position that the argument opposes; the second is a point that the argument raises to cast doubt on the reasoning used to support that position.
不理解这句话!!!! 疑问
