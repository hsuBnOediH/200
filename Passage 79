Elizabeth Bishop’s Complete Poems(1927-1979) has come to seem to most of its readers so achieved and sufficient as a life’s work that it is hard not to lose sight of how slowly Bishop wrote poems and of how few poems, finally, she completed.
Eb 的书(CP) 已从成为 看起来是 最让他读者满意的 作为 一个一生的作品 这是非常容易 lose sight 对于写这本书 会有多慢 和 很少, 最终他完成了
单词: 
lose sight 不注意

疑问  hard 和not 不抵消了吗????


But Bishop herself never ceased to find her productivity inadequate.
单词:
ceased 中断

The size and pace of her output were always in her eyes a failing (vaguely moral in complexion) for which she apologized throughout her career, although, as I will argue in this essay, Bishop’s inability to write more poems than she did was also a refusal to do so. 
单词：
pace　速度
refusal　拒绝
aguely moral in complexion　看不懂　疑问！！！

as I will argue in this essay, Bishop’s inability to write more poems than she did was also a refusal to do so. 

The small, manageable size of Bishop’s body of work has facilitated its　extraordinary critical reception since her death. (Robert Lowell, whose oeuvre is so much larger, has never had a complete edition of his poetry published.) 
extraordinary critical reception 这么看出来是正面 还是负面? 
Yet the size of her work is also a sign of Bishop’s alienation, that is, her uneasy, resistant relation to the literary culture that today claims her as the major poet of her generation.
