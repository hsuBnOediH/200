B
D
E

Much recent work has examined the claim that women encounter increasing obstacles relative to men as they move up the organizational ladder in business.
反应速度还不够: 
obstacles 阻碍 
ladder 梯子 不是ledder

This proposition, which we term the increasing-disadvantage model, is a core element of the popular glass ceiling metaphor.
容易混淆: 
proposition 理论 
proportion  比例

单词: 
metaphor 比喻 
metaphysical 形而上学的  (不行退学)

Despite continued widespread public acceptance of the glass ceiling idea and some consistent findings, most research to date has failed to support the increasing-disadvantage model.
反应速度还不够: 
consistent 一致的
Indeed, several studies based on private-sector firms find that women’ s mobility prospects improve, rather than decline, as they climb upward in corporate hierarchies. 
单词: prospects 前景
理解不透彻: sector 部门
In the public sector, researchers have found either no sex differences in mobility or a larger female disadvantage in lower grades.

Comparing cross-sectional national samples of workers, Baxter and Wright found no evidence in the United States, and only limited evidence in Sweden and Australia, that women’ s probability of being located in a higher versus a lower hierarchical level declined relative to men’ s at higher levels. 
混淆: 
versus 反之 
verse 诗歌(因为需要对仗)
that women’ s probability of being located in a higher versus a lower hierarchical level declined relative to men’ s at higher levels. 
这半句逻辑乱七八糟的!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



Taken together, these findings suggest that the glass ceiling may be a
myth.
Women’ s scarcity in top organizational ranks may simply represent the cumulative effect of a constant-or even decreasing-disadvantage at successive hierarchical levels.
反应速度还不够: 
scarcity 缺少

第二题做错因为 没仔细的去读选项 
recognized 这么无中生有的 也选了
A 跳过 是因为没反应太反应过了  
惯性思维想去选和文章大逻辑一致的选项!!!!


注意第三题题目   同时支持!!!!!!!  这样题目很多 注意读题!!!!!!
